# Banking System / ATM Simulator

## Overview
This project is a Banking System cum ATM Simulator developed as an Exploratory Project from January 2024 to February 2024. The system includes functionalities for account management, transactions, and customer interactions, providing a comprehensive solution for banking operations. The ATM interface incorporates authentication mechanisms with a database, enabling secure access to banking features.

## Features
- **Account Management**: Users can open accounts and update their information through the system.
- **Transactions**: The system supports various banking transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and balance inquiries.
- **Authentication Mechanism**: Secure authentication ensures only authorized users can access the system.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL database for storing user information and transaction records.
- **User Interface**: Developed using Java Swing for an intuitive and user-friendly ATM interface.
- **Development Environment**: Developed using NetBeans IDE with exposure to Java, Swing, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and MySQL.
